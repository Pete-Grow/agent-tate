# Agent Tate Platform

## Introduction

Agent Tate is a revolutionary decentralized autonomous AI agent platform that combines advanced artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Built on the Solana blockchain and integrated with pump.fun, this platform creates an innovative ecosystem where an AI agent interacts with and learns from its community while maintaining autonomous decision-making capabilities.

## Key Features

The platform integrates several groundbreaking features that set it apart in the Web3 space:

### AI Agent System
Our autonomous agent leverages the CrewAI framework and Mixtral-8x7b model to provide intelligent interactions and decision-making capabilities. The agent maintains consistent personality traits while learning from community input and market conditions.

### Community Interaction
The platform facilitates seamless interaction between users and the AI agent through:
- Real-time chat interface
- Content suggestion system
- Community voting mechanisms
- Reputation-based influence system

### Web3 Integration
Built on Solana for high performance and low transaction costs, featuring:
- Native token integration through pump.fun
- Smart contract-based governance
- Decentralized content distribution
- On-chain reputation tracking

### AI-Driven Mentorship
Revolutionary AI mentorship system providing:
- Personalized learning paths
- 24/7 guidance and support
- Adaptive content delivery
- Progress tracking and recommendations

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/install)"
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pete-Grow/agent-tate.git
cd agent-tate
```

2. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
